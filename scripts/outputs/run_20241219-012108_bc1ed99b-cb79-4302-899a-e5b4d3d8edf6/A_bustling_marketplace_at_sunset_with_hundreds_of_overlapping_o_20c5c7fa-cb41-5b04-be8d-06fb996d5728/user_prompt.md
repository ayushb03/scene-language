Here are some examples of how to use `helper.py`:
```python

IMPORTANT: THE FUNCTIONS ABOVE ARE JUST EXAMPLES, YOU CANNOT USE THEM IN YOUR PROGRAM! 

Now, write a similar program for the given task:    
```python
from helper import *

"""
A bustling marketplace at sunset with hundreds of overlapping objects like food stalls hanging lanterns moving crowds and children playing with kites while shadows lengthen dynamically
