### **1. Introduction**

The Scene Language represents a significant step forward in the representation of visual scenes, combining programs, words, and embeddings to capture structure, semantics, and identity. Despite its capabilities, it faces notable limitations in handling intricate, abstract, and computationally intensive tasks. This report outlines the shortcomings of the Scene Language, explores specific failure cases, and proposes detailed optimizations and architectural changes to address these issues. The goal is to make the rendering pipeline capable of generating visually stunning and complex scenes at faster speeds while accommodating abstract and imaginative queries.

- **Output:**

### **2.6. Lighting and Material Complexity**

- **Problem**: Limited realism in lighting and material effects, such as reflections or volumetric light.
- **Failure Case**: Scenes with dynamic lighting, like a disco hall, appear flat or unrealistic.
